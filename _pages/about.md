BS in Computer Science and Chemistry '22 🧪 + 💻\
Currently an MSCS student at UIUC 👩‍💻

Hey there! I hope you are having a great day! My name is Weijiang Li, or I can also go by Vicky. \
I'm a second-year MS student at U of I, where I also did my undergrad here. I have experience working on NLP projects in the chemistry domain, and I am currently exploring topics in bioinformatics/biomedical informatics with my MS thesis advisors Professor [Mohamed El-Kebir](https://www.el-kebir.net/) at [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu/) and Professor [Chris Cassa](http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/wiki/cassa/) at [HMS](https://dms.hms.harvard.edu/).
