BS in Computer Science and Chemistry '22 🧪 + 💻\
MS in Computer Science expected '24 👩‍💻

Hey there! \
I hope you are having a great day! My name is Weijiang Li(李玮江). \
I did my undergrad at UIUC and I'm continuing as a second-year Master's student. During my junior and senior year, I worked on NLP projects in the chemistry domain with Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) at [MMLI](https://moleculemaker.org/). I am currently working on topics in bio/biomedical informatics with my advisor Professor [Chris Cassa](http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/wiki/cassa/) at [HMS](https://dms.hms.harvard.edu/).
