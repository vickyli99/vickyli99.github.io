BS in Computer Science and Chemistry '22 🧪 + 💻\
Master's in Computer Science '23 👩‍💻

Hey there! \
I hope you are having a great day! My name is Weijiang Li (李玮江). 

I am currently working on accessing and evaluating genetic variant pathogenicity with my advisor Professor [Chris Cassa](http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/wiki/cassa/) at [HMS](https://dms.hms.harvard.edu/) and [BWH](https://bwhgenetics.org/). 

I did my undergrad and master's at UIUC🌽, where I worked on a HCI project with Professor [Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com/) and NLP and representation learning in the chemistry domain with Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) at [MMLI](https://moleculemaker.org/). 

I am interested in applying AI/LLM and computational methods to the science domain, specifically in biomedicine and chemistry. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss any project idea!
